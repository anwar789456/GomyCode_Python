      "Personal life: Donald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at Jamaica Hospital in Queens, New York City,[3] the fourth child of Fred Trump, a Bronx-born real-estate developer whose parents were German immigrants, and Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, an immigrant from Scotland. Trump grew up with older siblings Maryanne, Fred Jr., and Elizabeth and younger brother Robert in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens, and attended the private Kew-Forest School from kindergarten through seventh grade.[4][5][6] At age 13, he was enrolled at the New York Military Academy, a private boarding school,[7] and, in 1964, he enrolled at Fordham University. Two years later, he transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in May 1968 with a B.S. in economics.[8][9] In 2015, Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen threatened Trump's colleges, high school, and the College Board with legal action if they released Trump's academic records.[10]\n",

      "Family: In 1977, Trump married Czech model Ivana Zelníčková.[15] They had three children: Donald Jr. (born 1977), Ivanka (born 1981), and Eric (born 1984). Ivana became a naturalized United States citizen in 1988.[16] The couple divorced in 1990, following Trump's affair with actress Marla Maples.[17] Trump and Maples married in 1993 and divorced in 1999. They have one daughter, Tiffany (born 1993), who was raised by Marla in California.[18] In 2005, Trump married Slovenian model Melania Knauss.[19] They have one son, Barron (born 2006).[20] Melania gained U.S. citizenship in 2006.[21]\n",
      "Religion: Trump went to Sunday school and was confirmed in 1959 at the First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens.[22][23] In the 1970s, his parents joined the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan, which belongs to the Reformed Church in America.[22][24] The pastor at Marble, Norman Vincent Peale,[22] ministered to the family until his death in 1993.[24] Trump has described him as a mentor.[25] In 2015, the church stated that Trump was not an active member.[23] In 2019, he appointed his personal pastor, televangelist Paula White, to the White House Office of Public Liaison.[26] In 2020, he said he identified as a non-denominational Christian.[27]\n",
      "Health habits: Trump has called golfing his \"primary form of exercise\" but usually does not walk the course.[28] He considers exercise a waste of energy because he believes exercise depletes the body's energy \"like a battery, with a finite amount of energy\".[29] In 2015, Trump's campaign released a letter from his longtime personal physician, Harold Bornstein, stating that Trump would \"be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\".[30] In 2018, Bornstein said Trump had dictated the contents of the letter and that three Trump agents had seized his medical records in a February 2017 raid on the doctor's office.[30][31]\n",
      "Wealth: In 1982, Trump made the initial Forbes list of wealthy people for holding a share of his family's estimated $200 million net worth (equivalent to $606 million in 2022).[32] His losses in the 1980s dropped him from the list between 1990 and 1995.[33] After filing the mandatory financial disclosure report with the FEC in July 2015, he announced a net worth of about $10 billion. Records released by the FEC showed at least $1.4 billion in assets and $265 million in liabilities.[34] Forbes estimated his net worth dropped by $1.4 billion between 2015 and 2018.[35] In their 2021 billionaires ranking, Trump's net worth was estimated to be $2.4 billion (1,299th in the world).[36]\n",
      "Business career: Starting in 1968, Trump was employed at his father Fred's real-estate company, Trump Management, which owned middle-class rental housing in New York City's outer boroughs.[49][50] In 1971, he became president of the company and began using the Trump Organization as an umbrella brand.[51]  Between 1991 and 2009, he filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for six of his businesses, the Plaza hotel in Manhattan, the casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and the Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts company.[52]\n",
      "Real estate: Starting in 1968, Trump was employed at his father Fred's real-estate company, Trump Management, which owned middle-class rental housing in New York City's outer boroughs.[49][50] In 1971, he became president of the company and began using the Trump Organization as an umbrella brand.[51]  Between 1991 and 2009, he filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for six of his businesses, the Plaza hotel in Manhattan, the casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and the Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts company.[52]\n",
      "Manhattan developments: Trump attracted public attention in 1978 with the launch of his family's first Manhattan venture, the renovation of the derelict Commodore Hotel, adjacent to Grand Central Terminal.[53] The financing was facilitated by a $400 million city property tax abatement arranged by Fred Trump,[50] who also, jointly with Hyatt, guaranteed a $70 million in bank construction financing.[54] The hotel reopened in 1980 as the Grand Hyatt Hotel,[55] and that same year, Trump obtained rights to develop Trump Tower, a mixed-use skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan.[56] The building houses the headquarters of the Trump Corporation and Trump's PAC and was Trump's primary residence until 2019.[57][58]\n",
      "Atlantic City casinos: In 1984, Trump opened Harrah's at Trump Plaza, a hotel and casino, with financing and management help from the Holiday Corporation.[65] It was unprofitable, and Trump paid Holiday $70 million in May 1986 to take sole control.[66] In 1985, Trump bought the unopened Atlantic City Hilton Hotel and renamed it Trump Castle.[67] His wife Ivana managed it until 1988.[68] Both casinos filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1992.[69]\n",
      "Mar-a-Lago: In 1985, Trump acquired the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.[76] In 1995, he converted the estate into a private club with an initiation fee and annual dues. He continued to use a wing of the house as a private residence.[77] In 2019, Trump declared Mar-a-Lago his primary residence.[58]\n",
      "Golf courses: The Trump Organization began building and buying golf courses in 1999.[78] It owns fourteen and manages another three Trump-branded courses worldwide.[78][79]\n",
      "Licensing of the Trump brand: The Trump name has been licensed for various consumer products and services, including foodstuffs, apparel, adult learning courses, and home furnishings.[81][82] According to an analysis by The Washington Post, there are more than 50 licensing or management deals involving Trump's name, and they have generated at least $59 million in revenue for his companies.[83] By 2018, only two consumer goods companies continued to license his name.[81]\n",
      "Side ventures: In September 1983, Trump purchased the New Jersey Generals, a team in the United States Football League. After the 1985 season, the league folded, largely due to Trump's strategy of moving games to a fall schedule (when they competed with the NFL for audience) and trying to force a merger with the NFL by bringing an antitrust suit against the organization.[84][85]\n",
      "Trump University: In 2004, Trump co-founded Trump University, a company that sold real-estate training courses priced from $1,500 to $35,000.[99] After New York State authorities notified the company that its use of the word \"university\" violated state law (as it was not an academic institution), its name was changed to the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative in 2010.[100]\n",
      "Foundation: The Donald J. Trump Foundation was a private foundation established in 1988.[106][107] In the foundation's final years, its funds mostly came from donors other than Trump, who did not donate any personal funds to the charity from 2009 until 2014.[108] The foundation gave to health-care- and sports-related charities, as well as conservative groups.[109]\n",
      "Legal affairs and bankruptcies: Roy Cohn was Trump's fixer, lawyer and mentor for 13 years in the 1970s and 1980s.[118] According to Trump, Cohn sometimes waived fees due to their friendship.[118] In 1973, Cohn helped Trump countersue the United States government for $100 million (equivalent to $659 million in 2022)[32] over its charges that Trump's properties had racial discriminatory practices. Trump's counterclaims were dismissed, and the government's case went forward, ultimately resulting in a settlement.[119] In 1975, an agreement was struck requiring Trump's properties to furnish the New York Urban League with a list of all apartment vacancies, every week for two years, among other things.[120] Cohn introduced political consultant Roger Stone to Trump, who enlisted Stone's services to deal with the federal government.[121]\n",
      "Media career: Using ghostwriters, Trump has produced up to 19 books on business, financial, or political topics under his name.[127] His first book, The Art of the Deal (1987), was a New York Times Best Seller. While Trump was credited as co-author, the entire book was written by Tony Schwartz.[128] According to The New Yorker, \"The book expanded Trump's renown far beyond New York City, making him an emblem of the successful tycoon.\"[128] Trump has called the volume his second favorite book, after the Bible.[129]\n",

      "Film and television: Trump made cameo appearances in many films and television shows from 1985 to 2001.[130]\n",
      "Political career: Trump's political party affiliation has changed numerous times. He registered as a Republican in 1987;[141] a member of the Independence Party, the New York state affiliate of the Reform Party, in 1999;[142] a Democrat in 2001; a Republican in 2009; unaffiliated in 2011; and a Republican in 2012.[141]\n",
      "Presidential campaigns (2000–2016): In 2000, Trump ran in the California and Michigan primaries for nomination as the Reform Party candidate for the 2000 United States presidential election but withdrew from the race in February 2000.[146][147][148] A July 1999 poll matching him against likely Republican nominee George W. Bush and likely Democratic nominee Al Gore showed Trump with seven percent support.[149]\n",
      "2016 presidential campaign: Trump's fame and provocative statements earned him an unprecedented amount of free media coverage, elevating his standing in the Republican primaries.[154] He adopted the phrase \"truthful hyperbole\", coined by his ghostwriter Tony Schwartz, to describe his public speaking style.[128][155] His campaign statements were often opaque and suggestive,[156] and a record number of them were false.[157][158][159] The Los Angeles Times wrote, \"Never in modern presidential politics has a major candidate made false statements as routinely as Trump has.\"[160][161] Trump said he disdained political correctness and frequently made claims of media bias.[162][163]\n",
      "Campaign rhetoric and political positions: Trump's political positions and rhetoric were right-wing populist.[174][175][176] Politico described them as \"eclectic, improvisational and often contradictory\", quoting a health-care policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute as saying that his political positions were \"a total random assortment of whatever plays publicly\".[177] NBC News counted \"141 distinct shifts on 23 major issues\" during his campaign.[178]\n",
      "Financial disclosures: Trump's FEC-required reports listed assets above $1.4 billion and outstanding debts of at least $315 million.[34][191]\n",
      "Trump did not release his tax returns, contrary to the practice of every major candidate since 1976 and his promises in 2014 and 2015 to do so if he ran for office.[192][193] He said his tax returns were being audited, and his lawyers had advised him against releasing them.[194] After a lengthy court battle to block release of his tax returns and other records to the Manhattan district attorney for a criminal investigation, including two appeals by Trump to the United States Supreme Court, in February 2021 the high court allowed the records to be released to the prosecutor for review by a grand jury.[195][196]\n",
      "Election to the presidency: On November 8, 2016, Trump received 306 pledged electoral votes versus 232 for Clinton, though, after elector defections on both sides, the official count was ultimately 304 to 227.[198] Trump received nearly 2.9 million fewer popular votes than Clinton, which made him the fifth person to be elected president while losing the popular vote.[199] Trump also became the only president who neither served in the military nor held any government office prior to becoming president.[200] \n",
      "Trump's victory was a political upset.[201] Polls had consistently shown Clinton with a nationwide—though diminishing—lead, as well as an advantage in most of the competitive states. Trump's support had been modestly underestimated, while Clinton's had been overestimated.[202]\n",
      "Presidency (2017–2021): Trump was inaugurated on January 20, 2017. During his first week in office, he signed six executive orders, which authorized: interim procedures in anticipation of repealing the Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\"), withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, reinstatement of the Mexico City policy, advancement of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline construction projects, reinforcement of border security, and a planning and design process to construct a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.[207]\n",
      "Early actions: Trump was inaugurated on January 20, 2017. During his first week in office, he signed six executive orders, which authorized: interim procedures in anticipation of repealing the Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\"), withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, reinstatement of the Mexico City policy, advancement of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline construction projects, reinforcement of border security, and a planning and design process to construct a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.[207]\n",
      "Conflicts of interest: Before being inaugurated, Trump moved his businesses into a revocable trust run by his sons, Eric and Donald Jr., and a business associate.[210][211] He continued to profit from his businesses[212] and to know how his administration's policies affected his businesses.[211] Though Trump said he would eschew \"new foreign deals\", the Trump Organization pursued expansions of its operations in Dubai, Scotland, and the Dominican Republic.[212]\n",
      "Domestic policy: Trump took office at the height of the longest economic expansion in American history,[217] which began in June 2009 and continued until February 2020, when the COVID-19 recession began.[218]\n",
      "Economy: Trump took office at the height of the longest economic expansion in American history,[217] which began in June 2009 and continued until February 2020, when the COVID-19 recession began.[218]\n",
      "Climate change, environment, and energy: Trump rejects the scientific consensus on climate change.[225][226] He reduced the budget for renewable energy research by 40 percent and reversed Obama-era policies directed at curbing climate change.[227] In June 2017, Trump announced the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement, making the U.S. the only nation in the world to not ratify the agreement.[228]\n",
      "Deregulation: In January 2017, Trump signed Executive Order 13771, which directed that, for every new regulation, federal agencies \"identify\" two existing regulations for elimination, though it did not require elimination.[234] He dismantled many federal regulations on health,[235][236] labor,[237][236] and the environment,[238][236] among other topics. Trump signed 14 Congressional Review Act resolutions repealing federal regulations, including a bill that made it easier for severely mentally ill persons to buy guns.[239] During his first six weeks in office, he delayed, suspended, or reversed ninety federal regulations,[240] often \"after requests by the regulated industries\".[241] The Institute for Policy Integrity found that 78 percent of Trump's proposals were blocked by courts or did not prevail over litigation.[242]\n",
      "Health care: During his campaign, Trump vowed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA).[243] In office, he scaled back the Act's implementation through executive orders 13765[244] and 13813.[245] Trump expressed a desire to \"let Obamacare fail\"; his administration cut the ACA enrollment period in half and drastically reduced funding for advertising and other ways to encourage enrollment.[246][247] Trump falsely claimed he saved the coverage of pre-existing conditions provided by the ACA.[248] In June 2018, the Trump administration joined 18 Republican-led states in arguing before the Supreme Court that the elimination of the financial penalties associated with the individual mandate had rendered the ACA unconstitutional.[249][250] If they had succeeded, it would have eliminated health insurance coverage for up to 23 million Americans.[249] During the 2016 campaign, Trump promised to protect funding for Medicare and other social safety-net programs, but in January 2020, he suggested he was willing to consider cuts to such programs.[251]\n",
      "Social issues: Trump advocated for the reversal of Roe v. Wade. He said he supported \"traditional marriage\" but considered the nationwide legality of same-sex marriage a \"settled\" issue.[253] In March 2017, his administration rolled back key components of the Obama administration's workplace protections against discrimination of LGBT people.[254]\n",
      "Pardons and commutations: Most of Trump's pardons and commutations were granted to people with personal or political connections to him.[264] In his term, Trump sidestepped regular Department of Justice procedures for considering pardons; instead, he often entertained pardon requests from his associates or celebrities.[264]\n",
      "Lafayette Square protester removal and photo op: On June 1, 2020, federal law-enforcement officials used batons, rubber bullets, pepper spray projectiles, stun grenades, and smoke to remove a largely peaceful crowd of protesters from Lafayette Square, outside the White House.[274][275] Trump then walked to St. John's Episcopal Church, where protesters had set a small fire the night before; he posed for photographs holding a Bible, with senior administration officials later joining him in photos.[274][276] Trump said on June 3 that the protesters were cleared because \"they tried to burn down the church [on May 31] and almost succeeded\", describing the church as \"badly hurt\".[277]\n",
      "Immigration: Trump's proposed immigration policies were a topic of bitter and contentious debate during the campaign. He promised to build a wall on the Mexico–United States border to restrict illegal movement and vowed Mexico would pay for it.[280] He pledged to deport millions of illegal immigrants residing in the United States,[281] and criticized birthright citizenship for incentivizing \"anchor babies\".[282] As president, he frequently described illegal immigration as an \"invasion\" and conflated immigrants with the criminal gang MS-13,[283] though available research shows undocumented immigrants have a lower crime rate than native-born Americans.[284][285]\n",
      "Travel ban: Following the 2015 San Bernardino attack, Trump proposed to ban Muslim foreigners from entering the United States until stronger vetting systems could be implemented.[293] He later reframed the proposed ban to apply to countries with a \"proven history of terrorism\".[294]\n",
      "Family separation at border: The Trump administration separated more than 5,400 children of migrant families from their parents at the U.S.–Mexico border, a sharp increase in the number of family separations at the border starting from the summer of 2017.[304][305] In April 2018, the Trump administration announced a \"zero tolerance\" policy whereby every adult suspected of illegal entry would be criminally prosecuted.[306] This resulted in family separations, as the migrant adults were put in criminal detention for prosecution, while their children were separated as unaccompanied alien minors.[307] Administration officials described the policy as a way to deter illegal immigration.[308]\n",
      "Trump wall and government shutdown: One of Trump's central campaign promises was to build a 1,000-mile (1,600 km) border wall to Mexico and have Mexico pay for it.[317] By the end of his term, the U.S. had built \"40 miles [64 km] of new primary wall and 33 miles [53 km] of secondary wall\" in locations where there had been no barriers and 365 miles (587 km) of primary or secondary border fencing replacing dilapidated or outdated barriers.[318]\n",
      "Foreign policy: Trump described himself as a \"nationalist\"[331] and his foreign policy as \"America First\".[332] His foreign policy was marked by praise and support of populist, neo-nationalist and authoritarian governments.[333] Hallmarks of foreign relations during Trump's tenure included unpredictability and uncertainty,[332] a lack of a consistent foreign policy,[334] and strained and sometimes antagonistic relationships with the U.S.'s European allies.[335] He criticized NATO allies and privately suggested on multiple occasions that the United States should withdraw from the alliance.[336][337]\n",
      "Trade: In the 1980s, Trump publicly announced his skepticism of trade liberalization, saying, \"I believe very strongly in tariffs.\" In 2015, he sharply criticized NAFTA during the Republican primary campaign.[338][339] During his presidency, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations,[340] imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports,[341] and launched a trade war with China by sharply increasing tariffs on 818 categories (worth $50 billion) of Chinese goods imported into the U.S.[342] While Trump said that import tariffs are paid by China into the U.S. Treasury, they are paid by American companies that import goods from China.[343] Although he pledged during the campaign to significantly reduce the U.S.'s large trade deficits, the trade deficit in July 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, \"was the largest monthly deficit since July 2008\".[344] Following a 2017–2018 renegotiation, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) became effective in July 2020 as the successor to NAFTA.[345]\n",
      "Russia: The Trump administration \"water[ed] down the toughest penalties the U.S. had imposed on Russian entities\" after its 2014 annexation of Crimea.[346][347] Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, citing alleged Russian non-compliance,[348] and supported a potential return of Russia to the G7.[349]\n",
      "China: Before and during his presidency, Trump repeatedly accused China of taking unfair advantage of the U.S.[358] As president, Trump launched a trade war against China that was widely characterized as a failure,[359][360][361] sanctioned Huawei for its alleged ties to Iran,[362] significantly increased visa restrictions on Chinese students and scholars,[363] and classified China as a currency manipulator.[364] Trump also juxtaposed verbal attacks on China with praise of Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping,[365] which was attributed to trade war negotiations with the leader.[366] After initially praising China for its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic,[367] he began a campaign of criticism over its response starting in March 2020.[368]\n",
      "North Korea: In 2017, when North Korea's nuclear weapons were increasingly seen as a serious threat,[371] Trump escalated his rhetoric, warning that North Korean aggression would be met with \"fire and fury like the world has never seen\".[372][373] In 2017, Trump declared that he wanted North Korea's \"complete denuclearization\", and engaged in name-calling with leader Kim Jong Un.[372][374]\n",
      "Afghanistan: U.S. troop numbers in Afghanistan increased from 8,500 in January 2017 to 14,000 a year later,[383] reversing Trump's pre-election position critical of further involvement in Afghanistan.[384] In February 2020, the Trump administration signed a conditional peace agreement with the Taliban, which called for the withdrawal of foreign troops in 14 months \"contingent on a guarantee from the Taliban that Afghan soil will not be used by terrorists with aims to attack the United States or its allies\" and for the U.S. to seek the release of 5,000 Taliban imprisoned by the Afghan government.[385][386][387] By the end of Trump's term, 5,000 Taliban had been released, and, despite the Taliban continuing attacks on Afghan forces and integrating Al-Qaeda members into its leadership, U.S. troops had been reduced to 2,500.[387]\n",
      "Israel: Trump supported many of the policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.[388] Under Trump, the U.S. recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel[389] and Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights,[390] leading to international condemnation including from the United Nations General Assembly, the European Union, and the Arab League.[391][392]\n",
      "Saudi Arabia: Trump actively supported the Saudi Arabian–led intervention in Yemen against the Houthis and in 2017 signed a $110 billion agreement to sell arms to Saudi Arabia,[393] In 2018, the USA provided limited intelligence and logistical support for the intervention.[394][395] Following the 2019 attack on Saudi oil facilities, which the U.S. and Saudi Arabia blamed on Iran, Trump approved the deployment of 3,000 additional U.S. troops, including fighter squadrons, two Patriot batteries, and a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system (THAAD), to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.[396]\n",
      "Syria: Trump ordered missile strikes in April 2017 and in April 2018 against the Assad regime in Syria, in retaliation for the Khan Shaykhun and Douma chemical attacks, respectively.[397][398]\n",
      "Iran: After an Iranian missile test on January 29, 2017, and Houthi attacks on Saudi warships, the Trump administration sanctioned 12 companies and 13 individuals suspected of being involved in Iran's missile program.[406] In May 2018, Trump withdrew the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the 2015 agreement between Iran, the U.S., and five other countries that lifted most economic sanctions against Iran in return for Iran agreeing to restrictions on its nuclear program.[407][408] Analysts determined that, after the United States's withdrawal, Iran moved closer to developing a nuclear weapon.[409]\n",
      "Personnel: The Trump administration had a high turnover of personnel, particularly among White House staff. By the end of Trump's first year in office, 34 percent of his original staff had resigned, been fired, or been reassigned.[417] As of early July 2018[update], 61 percent of Trump's senior aides had left[418] and 141 staffers had left in the previous year.[419] Both figures set a record for recent presidents—more change in the first 13 months than his four immediate predecessors saw in their first two years.[420] Notable early departures included National Security Advisor Flynn (after just 25 days in office), and Press Secretary Sean Spicer.[420] Close personal aides to Trump including Bannon, Hope Hicks, John McEntee, and Keith Schiller quit or were forced out.[421] Some, including Hicks and McEntee, later returned to the White House in different posts.[422] Trump publicly disparaged several of his former top officials, calling them incompetent, stupid, or crazy.[423]\n",
      "Judiciary: Trump appointed 226 Article III judges, including 54 to the courts of appeals and three to the Supreme Court: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett.[435] Trump's Supreme Court nominees were noted as having politically shifted the Supreme Court to the right.[436][437][438][439] In the 2016 campaign, Trump pledged that Roe v. Wade would be overturned \"automatically\" if he were elected and provided the opportunity to appoint two or three pro-life justices. Trump later took credit when Roe was overturned in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization; all three of his Supreme Court nominees voted with the majority.[440][441][442]\n",
      "COVID-19 pandemic: In December 2019, COVID-19 erupted in Wuhan, China; the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread worldwide within weeks.[446][447] The first confirmed case in the U.S. was reported on January 20, 2020.[448] The outbreak was officially declared a public health emergency by Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar on January 31, 2020.[449]\n",
      "Initial response: Trump was slow to address the spread of the disease, initially dismissing the threat and ignoring persistent public health warnings and calls for action from health officials within his administration and Secretary Azar.[453][454] Throughout January and February he focused on economic and political considerations of the outbreak, and largely ignored the danger.[455] By mid-March, most global financial markets had severely contracted in response to the emerging pandemic.[456]\n",
      "White House Coronavirus Task Force: Trump established the White House Coronavirus Task Force on January 29, 2020.[468] Beginning in mid-March, Trump held a daily task force press conference, joined by medical experts and other administration officials,[469] sometimes disagreeing with them by promoting unproven treatments.[470] Trump was the main speaker at the briefings, where he praised his own response to the pandemic, frequently criticized rival presidential candidate Joe Biden, and denounced the press.[469][471] On March 16, he acknowledged for the first time that the pandemic was not under control and that months of disruption to daily lives and a recession might occur.[472] His repeated use of the terms \"Chinese virus\" and \"China virus\" to describe COVID-19 drew criticism from health experts.[473][474][475]\n",
      "World Health Organization: Prior to the pandemic, Trump criticized the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international bodies, which he asserted were taking advantage of U.S. aid.[482] His administration's proposed 2021 federal budget, released in February, proposed reducing WHO funding by more than half.[482] In May and April, Trump accused the WHO of \"severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus\" and alleged without evidence that the organization was under Chinese control and had enabled the Chinese government's concealment of the origins of the pandemic.[482][483][484] He then announced that he was withdrawing funding for the organization.[482] Trump's criticisms and actions regarding the WHO were seen as attempts to distract attention from his own mishandling of the pandemic.[482][485][486] In July 2020, Trump announced the formal withdrawal of the United States from the WHO effective July 2021.[483][484] The decision was widely condemned by health and government officials as \"short-sighted\", \"senseless\", and \"dangerous\".[483][484]\n",
      "Testing: In June and July, Trump said several times that the U.S. would have fewer cases of coronavirus if it did less testing, that having a large number of reported cases \"makes us look bad\".[487][488] The CDC guideline at the time was that any person exposed to the virus should be \"quickly identified and tested\" even if they are not showing symptoms, because asymptomatic people can still spread the virus.[489][490] In August 2020 the CDC quietly lowered its recommendation for testing, advising that people who have been exposed to the virus, but are not showing symptoms, \"do not necessarily need a test\". The change in guidelines was made by HHS political appointees under Trump administration pressure, against the wishes of CDC scientists.[491][492] The day after this political interference was reported, the testing guideline was changed back to its original recommendation, stressing that anyone who has been in contact with an infected person should be tested.[492]\n",
      "Pressure to abandon pandemic mitigation measures: In April 2020, Republican-connected groups organized anti-lockdown protests against the measures state governments were taking to combat the pandemic;[493][494] Trump encouraged the protests on Twitter,[495] even though the targeted states did not meet the Trump administration's own guidelines for reopening.[496] In April 2020, he first supported, then later criticized, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp's plan to reopen some nonessential businesses.[497] Throughout the spring he increasingly pushed for ending the restrictions as a way to reverse the damage to the country's economy.[498]\n",
      "Political pressure on health agencies: Trump repeatedly pressured federal health agencies to take actions he favored,[491] such as approving unproven treatments[504][505] or speeding up the approval of vaccines.[505] Trump administration political appointees at HHS sought to control CDC communications to the public that undermined Trump's claims that the pandemic was under control. CDC resisted many of the changes, but increasingly allowed HHS personnel to review articles and suggest changes before publication.[506][507] Trump alleged without evidence that FDA scientists were part of a \"deep state\" opposing him, and delaying approval of vaccines and treatments to hurt him politically.[508]\n",
      "Outbreak at the White House: On October 2, 2020, Trump tweeted that he had tested positive for COVID-19.[509][510] His wife, their son Barron, and numerous staff members and visitors also became infected.[511][512]\n",
      "Effects on the 2020 presidential campaign: By July 2020, Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic had become a major issue for the 2020 presidential election.[514] Biden sought to make the pandemic the central issue of the election.[515] Polls suggested voters blamed Trump for his pandemic response[514] and disbelieved his rhetoric concerning the virus, with an Ipsos/ABC News poll indicating 65 percent of respondents disapproved of his pandemic response.[516] In the final months of the campaign, Trump repeatedly claimed that the U.S. was \"rounding the turn\" in managing the pandemic, despite increasing numbers of reported cases and deaths.[517] A few days before the November 3 election, the United States reported more than 100,000 cases in a single day for the first time.[518]\n",
      "Investigations: After he assumed office, Trump was the subject of increasing Justice Department and congressional scrutiny, with investigations covering his election campaign, transition, and inauguration, actions taken during his presidency, along with his private businesses, personal taxes, and charitable foundation.[519] There were 30 investigations of Trump, including ten federal criminal investigations, eight state and local investigations, and twelve congressional investigations.[520]\n",
      "Hush money payments: During the 2016 presidential election campaign, American Media, Inc. (AMI), the parent company of the National Enquirer,[527] and a company set up by Cohen paid Playboy model Karen McDougal and adult film actress Stormy Daniels for keeping silent about their alleged affairs with Trump between 2006 and 2007.[528] Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to breaking campaign finance laws, saying he had arranged both payments at the direction of Trump to influence the presidential election.[529] Trump denied the affairs and claimed he was not aware of Cohen's payment to Daniels, but he reimbursed him in 2017.[530][531] Federal prosecutors asserted that Trump had been involved in discussions regarding non-disclosure payments as early as 2014.[532] Court documents showed that the FBI believed Trump was directly involved in the payment to Daniels, based on calls he had with Cohen in October 2016.[533][534] Federal prosecutors closed the investigation in 2019,[535] but the Manhattan District Attorney subpoenaed the Trump Organization and AMI for records related to the payments[536] and Trump and the Trump Organization for eight years of tax returns.[537] In November 2022, The New York Times reported that Manhattan prosecutors were \"newly optimistic about building a case\" against Trump.[538]\n",
      "Russian election interference: In January 2017, American intelligence agencies—the CIA, the FBI, and the NSA, represented by the Director of National Intelligence—jointly stated with \"high confidence\" that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election to favor the election of Trump.[539][540] In March 2017, FBI Director James Comey told Congress, \"[T]he FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. That includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts.\"[541] Many suspicious[542] links between Trump associates and Russian officials and spies were discovered and the relationships between Russians and \"team Trump\" were widely reported by the press.[543][544]\n",
      "FBI Crossfire Hurricane and 2017 counterintelligence investigations: In July 2016, the FBI launched an investigation, codenamed Crossfire Hurricane, into possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign.[555] After Trump fired FBI director James Comey in May 2017, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into Trump's personal and business dealings with Russia.[556] Crossfire Hurricane was transferred to the Mueller investigation,[557] but deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein ended the investigation into Trump's direct ties to Russia while giving the bureau the false impression that Mueller would pursue the matter.[558][559]\n",
      "Mueller investigation: In May 2017, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller, a former director of the FBI, special counsel for the Department of Justice (DOJ), ordering him to \"examine 'any links and/or coordination between the Russian government' and the Trump campaign\". He privately told Mueller to restrict the investigation to criminal matters \"in connection with Russia's 2016 election interference\".[558] The special counsel also investigated whether Trump's dismissal of James Comey as FBI director constituted obstruction of justice[560] and the Trump campaign's possible ties to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Qatar, Israel, and China.[561] Trump sought to fire Mueller and shut down the investigation multiple times but backed down after his staff objected or after changing his mind.[562]\n",
      "First impeachment: In August 2019, a whistleblower filed a complaint with the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community about a July 25 phone call between Trump and President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy, during which Trump had pressured Zelenskyy to investigate CrowdStrike and Democratic presidential candidate Biden and his son Hunter, adding that the White House had attempted to cover-up the incident.[588] The whistleblower stated that the call was part of a wider campaign by the Trump administration and Giuliani that may have included withholding financial aid from Ukraine in July 2019 and canceling Pence's May 2019 Ukraine trip.[589]\n",
      "Impeachment trial in the Senate: During the trial in January 2020, the House impeachment managers presented their case for three days. They cited evidence to support charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and asserted that Trump's actions were exactly what the founding fathers had in mind when they created the Constitution's impeachment process.[599]\n",
      "Responding over the next three days, Trump's lawyers did not deny the facts as presented in the charges but said Trump had not broken any laws or obstructed Congress.[600] They argued that the impeachment was \"constitutionally and legally invalid\" because Trump was not charged with a crime and that abuse of power is not an impeachable offense.[600]\n",
      "2020 presidential campaign: Breaking with precedent, Trump filed to run for a second term with the FEC within a few hours of assuming the presidency.[605] He held his first re-election rally less than a month after taking office[606] and officially became the Republican nominee in August 2020.[607]\n",
      "2020 presidential election: Starting in spring 2020, Trump began to sow doubts about the election, claiming without evidence that the election would be rigged and that the expected widespread use of mail balloting would produce massive election fraud.[615][616] In July, Trump raised the idea of delaying the election.[617] When, in August, the House of Representatives voted for a $25 billion grant to the U.S. Postal Service for the expected surge in mail voting, Trump blocked funding, saying he wanted to prevent any increase in voting by mail.[618] He repeatedly refused to say whether he would accept the results of the election and commit to a peaceful transition of power if he lost.[619][620]\n",
      "False claims of voting fraud, attempt to prevent presidential transition: At 2 a.m. the morning after the election, with the results still unclear, Trump declared victory.[624] After Biden was projected the winner days later, Trump stated that \"this election is far from over\" and baselessly alleged election fraud.[625] Trump and his allies filed many legal challenges to the results, which were rejected by at least 86 judges in both the state and federal courts, including by federal judges appointed by Trump himself, finding no factual or legal basis.[626][627] Trump's unsubstantiated allegations of widespread voting fraud were also refuted by state election officials.[628] After Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) director Chris Krebs contradicted Trump's fraud allegations, Trump dismissed him on November 17.[629] On December 11, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case from the Texas attorney general that asked the court to overturn the election results in four states won by Biden.[630]\n",
      "Concern about a possible coup attempt or military action: In December 2020, Newsweek reported the Pentagon was on red alert, and ranking officers had discussed what they would do if Trump decided to declare martial law. The Pentagon responded with quotes from defense leaders that the military has no role to play in the outcome of elections.[643]\n",
      "January 6 Capitol attack: On January 6, 2021, while congressional certification of the presidential election results was taking place in the United States Capitol, Trump held a noon rally at the Ellipse, Washington, D.C.. He called for the election result to be overturned and urged his supporters to \"take back our country\" by marching to the Capitol to \"show strength\" and \"fight like hell\".[648][649] Many supporters did, joining a crowd already there. Around 2:15 p.m. the mob broke into the building, disrupting certification and causing the evacuation of Congress.[650] During the violence, Trump watched TV and posted messages on Twitter without asking the rioters to disperse. At 6 p.m., Trump tweeted that the rioters should \"go home with love & in peace\", calling them \"great patriots\" and \"very special\" and repeating that the election was stolen from him.[651] After the mob was removed from the Capitol, Congress reconvened and confirmed the Biden election win in the early hours of the following morning.[652] According to the Department of Justice, more than 140 police officers were injured, and five people died.[653][654]\n",
      "Second impeachment: On January 11, 2021, an article of impeachment charging Trump with incitement of insurrection against the U.S. government was introduced to the House.[657] The House voted 232–197 to impeach Trump on January 13, making him the first U.S. president to be impeached twice.[658] Ten Republicans voted for the impeachment—the most members of a party ever to vote to impeach a president of their own party.[659]\n",
      "Post-presidency (2021–present): At the end of his term, Trump went to live at his Mar-a-Lago club.[664] As provided for by the Former Presidents Act,[665] he established an office there to handle his post-presidential activities.[665][666]\n",
      "Post-presidency investigations: Trump is the subject of several probes into his business dealings and his actions both before and during the presidency.[685] In February 2021, the district attorney for Fulton County, Georgia, Fani Willis, announced a criminal probe into Trump's phone calls to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.[686] The New York State Attorney General's Office is conducting criminal investigations into Trump's business activities in conjunction with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.[687] By May 2021, a special grand jury was considering indictments.[688][689] In July 2021, New York prosecutors charged the Trump Organization with a \"15 year 'scheme to defraud' the government\".[690] In January 2023, the organization's chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, was sentenced to five months in jail and five years probation for tax fraud after a plea deal.[691]\n",
      "FBI investigations: When Trump left the White House in January 2021, he took government documents and material with him to Mar-a-Lago. By May 2021, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the federal agency that preserves government records, realized that important documents had not been turned over to them at the end of Trump's term and asked his office to locate them. In January 2022, they retrieved 15 boxes of White House records from Mar-a-Lago. NARA later informed the Department of Justice that some of the retrieved documents were classified material.[696] The Justice Department began an investigation in April 2022 and convened a grand jury.[697] The Justice Department sent Trump a subpoena for additional material on May 11.[696] On June 3, Justice Department officials visited Mar-a-Lago and received some classified documents from Trump's lawyers.[696] One of the lawyers signed a statement affirming that all material marked as classified had been returned to the government.[698] Later that month an additional subpoena was sent requesting surveillance footage from Mar-a-Lago, which was provided.[696][699][700]\n",
      "Criminal referral by the House January 6 Committee: On December 19, 2022, the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack recommended criminal charges against Trump for obstructing an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and inciting or assisting an insurrection.[706]\n",
      "2024 presidential campaign: On November 15, 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 United States presidential election and set up a fundraising account.[707][708] In March 2023, the campaign began diverting 10 percent of the donations to Trump's leadership PAC which had paid $16 million for his legal bills by June 2023.[709]\n",
      "Indictments: In March 2023, a New York grand jury indicted Trump on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.[710][711] On April 4, he surrendered and was arrested and arraigned; he pleaded not guilty on all counts and was released. The judge scheduled the next in-person hearing for December 4; Trump has until August 8 to file any motions in the case.[712]\n",
      "Public image: Trump was the only president to never reach a 50 percent approval rating in the Gallup poll dating to 1938. His approval ratings showed a record-high partisan gap: 88 percent among Republicans and 7 percent among Democrats.[715] Until September 2020, the ratings were unusually stable, reaching a high of 49 percent and a low of 35 percent.[716] Trump finished his term with an approval rating between 29 percent and 34 percent—the lowest of any president since modern polling began—and a record-low average of 41 percent throughout his presidency.[715][717]\n",
      "Approval ratings and scholar surveys: Trump was the only president to never reach a 50 percent approval rating in the Gallup poll dating to 1938.

      "Social media: Trump's social media presence attracted worldwide attention after he joined Twitter in 2009. He tweeted frequently during the 2016 election campaign and as president until Twitter banned him in the final days of his term.[727] Over twelve years, Trump posted around 57,000 tweets, often using Twitter as a direct means of communication with the public and sidelining the press.[728] In June 2017, a White House press secretary said that Trump's tweets were official presidential statements.[729] Trump often announced terminations of administration officials and cabinet members over Twitter.[730]\n",
      "Relationship with the press: Trump sought media attention throughout his career, sustaining a \"love–hate\" relationship with the press.[740] In the 2016 campaign, Trump benefited from a record amount of free media coverage, elevating his standing in the Republican primaries.[154] The New York Times writer Amy Chozick wrote in 2018 that Trump's media dominance enthralled the public and created \"must-see TV.\"[741]\n",
      "False or misleading statements: As a candidate and as president, Trump frequently made false statements in public speeches and remarks[161][157] to an extent unprecedented in American politics.[756][757] His falsehoods became a distinctive part of his political identity.[756]\n",
      "Promotion of conspiracy theories: Before and throughout his presidency, Trump has promoted numerous conspiracy theories, including Obama birtherism, the Clinton body count conspiracy theory, QAnon, the Global warming hoax theory, Trump Tower wiretapping allegations, a John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theory involving Rafael Cruz, linking talk show host Joe Scarborough to the death of a staffer,[775] alleged foul-play in the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, alleged Ukrainian interference in U.S. elections, and that Osama bin Laden was alive and Obama and Biden had members of Navy SEAL Team 6 killed.[776][777][778][779][780] In at least two instances, Trump clarified to press that he also believed the conspiracy theory in question.[778]\n",
      "Racial views: Many of Trump's comments and actions have been considered racist.[784][785] In national polling, about half of respondents said that Trump is racist; a greater proportion believed that he emboldened racists.[786][787] Several studies and surveys found that racist attitudes fueled Trump's political ascent and were more important than economic factors in determining the allegiance of Trump voters.[788][789] Racist and Islamophobic attitudes are a powerful indicator of support for Trump.[790]\n",
      "Misogyny and allegations of sexual misconduct: Trump has a history of insulting and belittling women when speaking to media and on social media.[813][814] He made lewd comments, demeaned women's looks, and called them names, such as \"dog\", \"crazed\", \"crying lowlife\", \"face of a pig\", or \"horseface\".[814][815][816]\n",
      "Incitement of violence: Research suggests Trump's rhetoric caused an increased incidence of hate crimes.[823][824] During his 2016 campaign, he urged or praised physical attacks against protesters or reporters.[825][826] Numerous defendants investigated or prosecuted for violent acts and hate crimes, including participants of the January 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol, cited Trump's rhetoric in arguing that they were not culpable or should receive a lighter sentence.[827][828] A nationwide review by ABC News in May 2020 identified at least 54 criminal cases from August 2015 to April 2020 in which Trump was invoked in direct connection with violence or threats of violence mostly by white men and primarily against members of minority groups.[829]\n",
      "Popular culture: Trump has been the subject of parody, comedy, and caricature on television, in films, and in comics. He has been named in hundreds of hip hop songs since the 1980s—until 2015, most of these references cast Trump in a positive light, but they turned largely negative after he began running for office.[830]\n",
      ": In October 2016, two days before the second presidential debate, a 2005 \"hot mic\" recording surfaced in which Trump was heard bragging about kissing and groping women without their consent, saying that \"when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.  ... Grab 'em by the pussy.\"[820] The incident's widespread media exposure led to Trump's first public apology during the campaign[821] and caused outrage across the political spectrum.[822]\n"

      "Tunisia,[a] officially the Republic of Tunisia,[b][19] is the northernmost country in Africa. It is a part of the Maghreb region of North Africa, bordered by Algeria to the west and southwest, Libya to the southeast, and the Mediterranean Sea to the north and east. It features the archaeological sites of Carthage dating back to the 9th century BC, as well as the Great Mosque of Kairouan. Known for its ancient architecture, souks and blue coasts, it covers 163,610 km2 (63,170 sq mi), and has a population of 12.1 million. It contains the eastern end of the Atlas Mountains and the northern reaches of the Sahara desert; much of its remaining territory is arable land. Its 1,300 km (810 mi) of coastline include the African conjunction of the western and eastern parts of the Mediterranean Basin. Tunisia is home to Africa's northernmost point, Cape Angela; and its capital and largest city is Tunis, which is located on its northeastern coast, and lends the country its name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beginning in early antiquity, Tunisia was inhabited by the indigenous Berbers. Phoenicians began to arrive in the 12th century BC, establishing several settlements, of which Carthage emerged as the most powerful by the 7th century BC. Carthage was a major mercantile empire and a military rival to the Roman Republic until 146 BC, when it was defeated by the Romans who occupied Tunisia for most of the next 800 years. The Romans introduced Christianity and left architectural legacies like the Amphitheatre of El Jem. In the 7th century AD, Arab Muslims conquered all of Tunisia (finally succeeding in 697 after several attempts starting in 647) and settled with their tribes and families, brought Islam and Arab culture to the local inhabitants, and since then Arabs became the majority of the population. Then, in 1546, the Ottoman Empire established control there, holding sway for over 300 years, until 1881, when the French conquered Tunisia. In 1956, Tunisia gained independence as the Tunisian Republic under the leadership of Habib Bourguiba with the help of activists such as Chedly Kallala, Farhat Hached and Salah Ben Youssef. Today, Tunisia's culture and identity are rooted in this centuries-long intersection of different cultures and ethnicities.\n",
